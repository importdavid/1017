1017 MSG Application
Begin 8/15/2022 7pm

    Raspberry Pi 3 set up as server on NETGEAR19 WAN
    192.168.1.2
    scp -r 1017/ david@192.168.1.2:~/
    Environment Variables for wsl testing: sudo nano ~/.bashrc

    Automates execution (repetitive @ 1017 am and pm)
        I want it to do something particularly special yearly on the date 10/17
        Can I achieve this with just a python script and the time module?
            Would have to be upgraded to achieve more functionality (feedback loop for algorithm idea below)
        A difference in style/content between AM and PM seems fun, explore this
        I could use PythonAnywhere to schedule the script as a bi-daily task
            I don't like this option because it exposes sensitive/private info within code
        Cron Job
            8/16/2022 Successfully scheduled
                Will only work if computer remains on/unlocked
            Maybe instead I should run on a raspberry pi, headless
        Windows Task Scheduler
            Apparently I can put the computer in "Connected Standby" mode, then wake with Scheduler to run script

    Generates thoughtful content (message, picture, conveys love)
        Can I create an algorithm to deliver better and better messages?
            Can I accept feedback through text?
        8/20/2022 Currently working on a repo of my own pictures of Atlas
            Can deliver one at random from image folder along with GPT-3 poem by Atlas

            Ting Mobile contracts with a third-party spam filter service   
                This blocks all sms sent from smtp/gmail
                    Hard to cirvumvent, might be enough reason to switch providers

    Bug Bounty
        Sometimes images are too big to be sent through gmail
            Check image size and resize if necessary
            Should I resize all images in the folder? Resize when taking/uploading?
            FIXED: Just made all images into thumbnails, ~20mb to ~20kb
        AI Haiku sometimes repeats
            need to seed with a better setup
            Somewhat Fixed: Create a random madlib setup with various lists of keywords
                Then feed that to gpt3 to generate poem

I scratch, I eat, I vocalize-
Alas, my day was quite uneventful.
But all was not lost, for I did spy
A deer outside, so fresh and new.
I long to taste its juicy flesh,
But sadly, 'tis not meant to be

I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless,
I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless,
I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless,
I'm restless, I'm restless, I'm restless

A pot is bubbling on the stove
The sound of sizzling makes my stomach grumble
I open my eyes and see the kitchen
Mysterious Neighbor Cat is cooking breakfast
I watch as she cracks eggs into the pan
The smell of frying makes my mouth water
I meow for
